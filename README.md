## UX

### User Stories

#### First Time Visitor Goals

#### Returning Visitor Goals

#### Frequent User Goals

### Strategy

#### Business goals

* Are the same as the user goals for this project, to enjoy playing the game and learn new facts!

#### User Goals

* To improve their chemistry knowledge.

* To learn new facts about chemistry.

* To enjoy playing the game while learning at the same time.

### Scope

Key features to be included based on user stories are:

* Responsive website on mobile, tablet and laptop size devices.

* Interactive elements: 
  * Navbar becomes a burger menu on mobile.

### Structure

All pages of the website will have a consistent navigation bar - which collapses when viewed on a small screen.

The website will use bootstrap grids to make the layout responsive to different devices and screen sizes.

### Skeleton

I used Balsamiq to make the wireframes for this project. The website was designed to have x pages - xxx, xxx and xxx.
The wireframes were created for all pages for phone, tablet and desktop devices.

## Features

### Existing Features

* Responsive on mobile, tablet and laptop size devices.

* Interactive elements:
  * Navbar becomes a burger menu on mobile.


### Features Left to Implement

* It would be nice to have a larger number of question options for the quiz. 

* This concept could also be expanded to include quizzes for other subjects of interest such as biology and physics.

## Technologies Used

* HTML - used to create the main content for the website.

* CSS - used to add style and colour to the content.

* Javascript - used to make responsive to the user's input.

* [Bootstrap Version 4.1.3](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/getting-started/download/)
  * Used grid layout to ensure the content was responsive to different device sizes (mobile, tablet and laptop).
  * Used to that the navbar could collapse when viewed on small screens but expand on medium and larger size screens.

* [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/) - used to write the code for the website.

* [GitHub](https://github.com/) - used to store the current and previous versions of the code. It was also used to host the live website through GitHub Pages. 

* [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - used to import the Roboto Slab and Montserrat font families that 
are used throughout the website.

* [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) - used to display the social media icons in the footer of each page.

* [Balsamiq Wireframes](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/) - used to create the wireframes for the website.

* [Tinypng](https://tinypng.com/) - used to compress the images so they loaded quicker on the website.

* [Am I Responsive](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/#) - used for the mockups of the website on different devices.

## Testing

#### Manual Testing

### Online Validation

* I checked the website loads and responds as expected on Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer browsers.  
I specifically checked the navbar and carousel work as expected on these browsers also.

* Used chrome developer tools and [responsinator](https://www.responsinator.com/) to check responsiveness on mobile, tablet and laptop devices.  
I also checked the website on my HP 15 inch laptop, Philips 20 inch monitor and Sony smartphone.

* Used the [w3c validator](https://validator.w3.org/) to validate my html (for all 3 pages of the website) to check for no errors or warnings. 
* Used the [jigsaw validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input) to validate my style.css file to check for no errors or warnings. 
I did not validate css of the whole website as this included the imported bootstrap files.

### Lighthouse Validation

I used [lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) in chrome developer tools to check the websites performance in terms of 
performance, accessibility, best practises and SEO.

### Fixed Bugs

#### Minor Fixes

## Deployment

### Creation

* All code was written in Gitpod and used [this template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template) from Code Institute.
* Files were added to the staging area using "git add ."
* Files were committed to the local repository using "git commit -m 'commit message here'".
* Committed changes were pushed to the GitHub repository.

### GitHub Pages

To deploy the project to a live website the below steps were followed:

* Navigate to the GitHub repository you wish to deploy.
* Click on Settings and scroll to the "GitHub Pages" section.
* Choose "master branch" as the source and click save.
* Scroll back down to the "GitHub Pages" section and the deployed website link will be given.
* Note: It can take a few moments for the website to be deployed, so the link may not work immediately 
after you deploy using GitHub Pages.

### Local Clone
To make a local copy of a repository on your own GitHub account you can clone it.
This allows others to view the original code and/or make changes to it (on their own local copy).
Changing the code on your local repository will not affect the original code or deployed website.

To clone a repository in GitHub you can follow the steps below:
* Log into GitHub and locate the repository you wish to clone.
* Click on the code button (to the left of the green Gitpod button) and copy the https URL given.
* Open Gitpod (or another editor if you prefer).
* Use the "git clone 'insert copied URL here'" command.
* A clone of the original repository will now be available for you locally 
on your own repository to view/edit as you wish.

### Forking

Forking is another way to  make a local copy of a repository on your own GitHub account to do this follow the below steps:

* Log into GitHub and locate the repository you wish to fork.
* At the top-right of the repository (and top-right of the green Gitpod button), locate the fork button.
* A copy of the original repository will now be available for you locally 
on your own repository to view/edit as you wish.

## Credits

### Code

* The bootstrap library was used to help make this website responsive for different devices. 

* Bootstrap also allowed me to create a dropdown navigation bar for smaller devices.  

### Content

* I used images from online, information below in the media section.

* Questions for the quiz from sites: xxxxxxx.

* I had a look at exisiting quizzes on sites to gain information on what features to include for my own quiz game: xxxxx.

### Media

* I found the following images online from [website link](https://www.pexels.com/): 
  * img1 - owner xxxx xxxx [image link here](https://www.pexels.com/photo/white-horse-running-on-green-field-1996337/)
 
* Please note I did minor editing (cropping only) to some of these photos.
